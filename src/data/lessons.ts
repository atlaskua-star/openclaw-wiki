## 2.1 The Workspace

Your workspace lives at:

\`\`\`bash
cd ~/.openclaw/workspace
\`\`\`

This is where everything lives — projects, notes, configuration. It's also where I (the AI) create and manage files.

Key files already there:

| File | Purpose |
|---|---|
| \`AGENTS.md\` | My operating manual and your preferences |
| \`SOUL.md\` | My personality and boundaries |
| \`USER.md\` | Info about you |
| \`MEMORY.md\` | My long-term memory |
| \`HEARTBEAT.md\` | Periodic background checks |
| \`TOOLS.md\` | Environment-specific notes |

---

## 2.2 Creating Projects

Projects go inside the \`projects/\` folder:

\`\`\`
workspace/
└── projects/
    └── openclaw-wiki/    ← the wiki we just built
        ├── src/
        ├── package.json
        └── ...
\`\`\`

When you want to start something new, just tell me. I'll scaffold the structure, write the code, install deps, and get it running.

---

## 2.3 How I Work With Files

I can do all of these just by asking:

| Action | How it works |
|---|---|
| Read files | \`read path/to/file\` |
| Create files | \`write path/to/file\` with content |
| Edit files | \`edit\` with exact text replacement |
| Run commands | \`exec command\` (I show output) |
| List directories | \`ls -la\` via exec |
| Search code | grep or memory search |

---

## 2.4 Best Practices

- **One project = one folder** inside \`projects/\`
- Each project should have a \`README.md\` explaining what it does
- Use Git for version control (like we did with the wiki)
- Keep the workspace clean — don't scatter files at root

---

**Tip:** Anything we build, I'll keep inside \`projects/\`. If you ever need to find something, just ask.

## 3.1 What Are Skills?

Skills are markdown instruction files that teach the AI how and when to use specific tools. Each skill lives in a directory with a \`SKILL.md\` file.

They're like plugins — you can install community skills from **ClawHub**, write your own, or use the built-in ones I already have.

---

## 3.2 Where Skills Live

OpenClaw loads skills from several places, in priority order:

| Priority | Location | Path |
|---|---|---|
| 1 (highest) | Workspace skills | \`<workspace>/skills/\` |
| 2 | Project agent skills | \`<workspace>/.agents/skills/\` |
| 3 | Personal agent skills | \`~/.agents/skills/\` |
| 4 | Managed skills | \`~/.openclaw/skills/\` |
| 5 | Bundled skills | shipped with OpenClaw |

When the same skill name appears in multiple places, the higher priority wins.

---

## 3.3 Searching & Installing Skills

Search ClawHub for community skills:

\`\`\`bash
openclaw skills search "calendar"
openclaw skills search "weather"
openclaw skills search --limit 20
\`\`\`

Install from ClawHub:

\`\`\`bash
openclaw skills install @owner/skill-name
\`\`\`

Install from Git:

\`\`\`bash
openclaw skills install git:owner/repo
openclaw skills install git:owner/repo@main
\`\`\`

Install from a local directory:

\`\`\`bash
openclaw skills install ./path/to/skill --as custom-name
\`\`\`

---

## 3.4 Managing Installed Skills

\`\`\`bash
# List all installed skills
openclaw skills list
openclaw skills list --verbose

# Get info about a skill
openclaw skills info <name>

# Check which skills are ready to run
openclaw skills check

# Update a skill
openclaw skills update @owner/slug
openclaw skills update --all

# Verify a ClawHub skill
openclaw skills verify @owner/slug
\`\`\`

---

## 3.5 Creating Your Own Skill

Every skill is just a folder with a \`SKILL.md\` file:

\`\`\`
~/.openclaw/workspace/skills/my-skill/
└── SKILL.md
\`\`\`

Example \`SKILL.md\`:

\`\`\`markdown
---
name: my-skill
description: What this skill does
---

# Instructions

Tell the agent what to do when this skill is relevant.
\`\`\`

You can even create skills through me — I can use the Skill Workshop to draft and propose them for your review.

---

## 3.6 Built-in Skills I Already Have

Currently loaded skills include:

- **github** — GitHub CLI, issues, PRs, releases
- **weather** — current weather and forecasts
- **notion** — Notion API for pages, databases, search
- **clawhub** — Search and install skills from ClawHub
- **diagram-maker** — Create SVG diagrams and whiteboards
- **meme-maker** — Generate memes from templates
- **browser-automation** — Control web pages
- **tmux** — Terminal multiplexer control
- **taskflow** — Multi-step detached task coordination
- **video-frames** — Extract frames from videos
- **more...** (music, canvas, spike, healthcheck, etc.)

---

---

## 3.7 Real Example: Installing From ClawHub

We installed **skill-vetter** — a security scanner that checks other skills for red flags before installation:

\`\`\`bash
openclaw skills install skill-vetter
\`\`\`

Now I can vet any skill before installing:

\`\`\`
"Vet this skill before I install it"
\`\`\`
